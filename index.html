	<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso, or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	
	<h2>WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS VERSION OF THE GAME</h2>
	<p>This version is played using the major arcana of the Tarot. As you make matches, I'll be able to tell your fortune!</p>
